title :- cap theorem
adapted from Ravikiran 

cassandra was developed by the facebook group.The CAP theorem (Brewer) states that you have to pick two of Consistency, Availability, and
Partition tolerance: You can't have the three at the same time and get an acceptable latency”
Cassandra values Availability and partitioning tolerance (AP). Cassandra is built to store lots and
lots and lots of data across a variety of machines arranged in a ring, as opposed to the trend
within relational database thinking that says “buy a bigger box”.


Cassandra forgoes the widely used Master-Slave setup, in favor of a peer-to-peer
cluster. Cassandra addresses the problem of failures by employing a peer-to-peer distributed
system where all nodes are the same and data is distributed among all nodes in the cluster.
Each node exchanges information across the cluster every second.


Cassandra's architecture allows any authorized user to connect to any node in any
data center and access data using the CQL language. CQL uses a similar syntax to SQL. From the
CQL perspective the database consists of tables.

Cassandra uses a protocol called “gossip” to discover location and state
information about the other nodes participating in a Cassandra cluster. Gossip is a peer-to-peer
communication protocol in which nodes periodically exchange state information about
themselves and about other nodes they know about.
The gossip process runs every second and exchanges state messages with up to
three other nodes in the cluster. The nodes exchange information about themselves and about
the other nodes that they have gossiped about, so all nodes quickly learn about all other nodes
